# Udacity React Nanodegree - Project 3
> Udacicards: A Mobile Flashcard App

## Why this project?
Project was created for the sole purpose of learning new technology. Short description of what it does: 
"This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input." - via udacity.com. If you'd like to learn more about react nanodegree program please visit: https://udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019.

## Usage

If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.
### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Supported devices
Project was tested on iOS simulator and on iOS device via Expo. Unfortunatelly tests on Android were not done due to lack of time.
