"This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input." - via udacity.com. If you'd like to learn more about react nanodegree program please visit: https://udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019.

## Usage
Install all the necessary dependencies
### `npm instal` or `yarn install`

Run the project (in development mode):
### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
